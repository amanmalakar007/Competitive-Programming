Two players are playing a game where white or black pieces are represented by a string, colors. The game rules are as follows: 

• Wendy moves first and then they take alternate turns.
• With each move, Wendy may remove a white piece that has adjacent white pieces on both sides.
• Likewise, with each move, Bob may remove any black piece that has adjacent black pieces on both sides.
• After a piece is removed, the string is reduced in size by one piece. For instance, removing 'Y'from 'XYZ' results in 'XZ'.
• When a player can no longer move, they have lost the game. 

Example colors = 'wwwbbbbwww' 
Wendyremoves the piece 'w' at index 1, colors = 'wwbbbbwww'
Bob removes the piece 'b' at index 3, colors = 'wwbbbwww'
Wendy removes the piece 'w' at index 6, colors = 'wwbbbww'
Bob removes the piece 'b' from index 3, colors = 'wwbbww' 
Wendy has no other move, so Bob wins. Return 'bob'.

Determine who wins if Wendy and Bob both play with optimum skill. Return the string 'wendy' or 'bob'.
